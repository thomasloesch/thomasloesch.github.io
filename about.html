				<p>Hi, my name is Thomas Loesch. I am a senior at Bowling Green Statue University, where I am currently working on my bachelor's degree in computer science. I have been interested computers and programming since high school. In the course of my schooling, I have been exposed to many different programming languages. Though I would not consider myself amazing with all of them, here is a list of all the languages/technologies I have used:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Java</li>
					<li>C#</li>
					<li>C++</li>
					<li>HTML/CSS</li>
					<li>PHP</li>
					<li>MySql</li>
					<li>.NET</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In the future, I would like to find work as a software engineer/developer. I am currently looking for internships in a variety of posistions though, so this may change. In the end, programming is both a passion, and a fascination for me. I don't know what I'll use this site for, but hopefully I can put my personal projects here for you all to see.
				</p>
